# Gofannon Documentation  
Welcome to the Gofannon documentation! This project provides a collection of tools and APIs for working with large language models.  
  
## Overview  
Gofannon is designed to provide a flexible and extensible framework for building applications on top of large language models. The toolbox includes a range of tools and APIs for tasks such as text generation, question answering, and conversational dialogue.  
  
## Getting Started  
To get started with Gofannon, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.html) guide for information on how to contribute to the project.  

## Logging

See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md)

## APIs  
Gofannon provides a range of APIs for working with large language models. These APIs are organized into several categories, including:  
  
* [ArXiv API](arxiv/): provides access to arXiv papers and metadata  
* [Basic Math API](basic_math/): provides basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
* [GitHub API](github/): provides access to GitHub repositories and issues  
* [NHTSA API](nhsta/): provides access to NHTSA vehicle safety data  
* [Reasoning API](reasoning/): provides tools for reasoning and problem-solving with large language models  
  
## Tools  
Gofannon also provides a range of tools for working with large language models. These tools include:  
  
* [Sequential Chain-of-Thought](reasoning/sequential_cot.html): a tool for generating sequential chains of thought with large language models  
* [Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought](reasoning/hierarchical_cot.html): a tool for generating hierarchical chains of thought with large language models  
* [Tree-of-Thought](reasoning/tree_of_thought.html): a tool for generating tree-like structures of thought with large language models
