# How to Contribute to Gofannon

This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new function to the Gofannon repository. We'll cover everything from forking the repo to creating a pull request.

## 1. Fork the Repository
**TODO: Add link to forking in GitHub**

First, you'll need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the main project.

## 2. What Makes a Good Function?
When proposing a new function, consider these guidelines:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Simple Interface**: Keep the API surface small and intuitive
- **Clear Documentation**: Include thorough documentation and examples
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging
- **Modular Design**: If an API has many functions, split them into multiple classes

## 3. Create an Issue
Before starting development, create an issue describing your proposed function:

1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Use the "Function Proposal" template
4. Include:
    - Description of the function
    - Use cases
    - Proposed API interface
    - Any dependencies

**TODO: Add link to Issues tab**

## 4. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Clone your forked repository and set up the development environment:

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gofannon.git  
cd gofannon  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## 5. Creating a New Function
### Directory Structure
Add your function under the appropriate directory in `gofannon/`. If it's a new API, create a new directory.

### Base Class Extension
All functions must extend the `BaseTool` class. Here's the basic structure:

```python  
from gofannon.base import BaseTool
from gofannon.config import FunctionRegistry


@FunctionRegistry.register
class NewFunction(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self, name="new_function"):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name

    @property
    def definition(self):
        return {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": self.name,
                "description": "Description of what the function does",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "param1": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "Description of param1"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["param1"]
                }
            }
        }

    def fn(self, param1):
        # Implementation goes here  
        try:
            # Your code  
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.log_error(f"Error in new_function: {str(e)}")
            raise  
```

### Required Components
1. **Definition**: The JSON schema defining the function's interface
2. **fn**: The main function implementation
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and logging
4. **Documentation**: Add documentation in the `docs/` directory

### Documentation
Create a markdown file in the appropriate documentation directory:

```markdown
# New Function

## Description
Brief description of what the function does

## Parameters
- `param1`: Description of param1

## Example Usage
```python  
new_func = NewFunction()  
result = new_func.fn("example")  
-```
```

Add a link to your documentation in the appropriate index.md file.

## 6. Testing Your Function

### Running Tests Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gofannon.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run tests: `pytest tests/`

### GitHub Action

The GitHub Action will run automatically on pull requests to the main branch. You can view the test results in the GitHub Actions tab.

Write unit tests for your function. Create a new test file in the tests/ directory:

```python
import pytest
from gofannon.new_api.new_function import NewFunction


def test_new_function():


    func = NewFunction()
result = func.fn("test")
assert result == expected_value
```

## 7. Committing Your Changes

Create a new branch for your feature:  
```bash  
git checkout -b feature/new-function  
```

Add and commit your changes. It's essential to include a DCO (Developer 
Certificate of Origin) sign off in your commit message. This sign off is a 
simple way for contributors to certify that they have the right to submit their 
work under the open-source license. By signing off on your commit, you're 
confirming that you're the original author of the work or have the necessary 
permissions to contribute it.

```bash  
git add --all  
git commit --signoff  
```

The `--signoff` flag will automatically append a "Signed-off-by" line to your 
commit message with your name and email address. You can learn more about DCO 
sign off on the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/signing-commits).

Push your branch:  
```bash  
git push origin feature/new-function  
```

By including the DCO sign off, you're helping to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of the project and making it easier for others to use and 
distribute the code.

## 8. Creating a Pull Request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub
Click "Compare & pull request"
Fill out the PR template:
    Description of changes
    Related issues
    Testing performed
Submit the PR

**TODO: Add link to PR creation**

## 9. Code Review

Be prepared to address feedback during code review. Common requests include:

* Adding more test cases
* Improving documentation
* Refactoring for better performance or readability

Tips for Success

* Keep your PRs focused on a single feature
* Write clear commit messages
* Follow the existing code style
* Add comprehensive documentation
* Include meaningful test cases
* Be responsive to code review feedback
