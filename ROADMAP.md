# Project Gofannon  - Roadmap
  
This project contains tools that can be used in LLMs. Each tool is designed to perform specific functions and can be extended or customized based on your needs.

## Status Icons  
  
- :white_check_mark: **Implemented**: This tool is fully implemented and ready for use.  
- :construction: **In Progress**: This tool is currently under development.  
- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Roadmap**: This tool is planned for future implementation.  
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: **Low Priority**: This tool is considered low priority and may be implemented in the future.  
- :x: **Won't Implement**: There are no plans to implement this tool.  
  
## Usage  
  
To use a tool, extend the `BaseTool` class in your implementation:  
  
```python  
from base_tool import BaseTool  
  
class CustomTool(BaseTool):  
    @property  
    def definition(self):  
        return {  
            "name": "CustomTool",  
            "description": "This is a custom tool example",  
            "version": "1.0.0"  
        }  
  
    def fn(self, *args, **kwargs):  
        # Implement your functionality here  
        pass  
```
