## 🎓🎓 Why the name `gofannon`? 🎓🎓

See [`why_the_name_gofannon`](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/gofannon/about/the_name_gofannon/) for the rich story on why we chose to honor this Celtic Diety

## ⚡️⚡️Quickstart ⚡️⚡️

```bash  
pip install gofannon  
```

gofannon is an ambitious upstart, things are happening fast. We have a git
action that deploys to PyPi every Monday morning, so `pip install gofannon`
will get you pretty close to the tip of the spear. But if you absolutely _must_
have the latest and greatest, this will work too:

```bash
git+https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/gofannon.git@main
```

For more information, see our [quickstart guide](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/gofannon/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md).
